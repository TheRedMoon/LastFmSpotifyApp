# LastFmSpotifyApp

This is an application that let's you make playlists on spotify using LastFM data.
If you have any suggestions or want to help, it's always welcome!

Few Begin Steps: 
1. You first login onto your spotify 
2. Add users in the user tab (manage users). If you click on the user added it will change color from green to red making that user inactive. Also note that these users are LastFM users and should be case sensitive. 
3. You can add a playlist in the manage playlist. Here you have to press the confirm button. This can be an existing playlist or if it does not exists (underneath your spotify account) then a new one is created for you. 
4. in Options, please set your options as you would like them, with limit being the songs pulled per users, the period the period of lastfm scrobbles and the overwrite songs whether to overwrite the playlist or simply add the tracks to the playlist. 
5. If all is set then you can create playlist by clicking the button create playlist which will then show a list of songs found and try to put it into the spotify playlist.

Disclaimer: The GUI is ugly and the app is buggy.
